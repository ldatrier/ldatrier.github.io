Hello, and welcome!

I am a postdoctoral associate at California State University Fullerton working on site evaluation for Cosmic Explorer, a proposed US next-generation terrestrial gravitational wave detector. When I'm not looking at and thinking about maps, I also do some gravitational wave cosmology as part of the LIGO collaboration, with a focus on galaxy catalogue systematics. 


I obtained my PhD in Physics and Astronomy from the University of Glasgow in 2023. During that time, I have worked on multi-messenger astronomy with kilonovae, gravitational wave cosmology and detector calibration as part of the LIGO collaboration.


When I'm not doing research, I enjoy getting involved in various outreach activities! I started getting involved in astronomy outreach during my undergraduate degree, and haven't stopped since. I have since been involved in and organised many events from talks and festivals to observing evenings, and worked with a variety of audiences.

I'm also a hobby artist and have made a lot of art inspired by my work, some of which you can find on this website.
